# AI Interaction Log
This document serves as a log of interactions with AI systems, capturing prompts, responses, and 
reflections on the outcomes. It is intended to help users track their engagements with AI and 
improve future interactions.






## Interaction 1 Shape3d
Can you create me a class in Java called Shape3d inside the package com.csc205.project2.shapes 
package, that implements the interface ThreeDimensionalShape containing abstract methods double 
getSurfaceArea() and double getVolume(). Create concrete implementations of getVolume() and 
getSufaceArea() in Shape3D that call the abstract methods from the interface. Create 2 property 
variables String name and String color, and can you make them private, but create getters and 
setters that are public for each of those properties. Create the constructor for the class for 
initialization. Create a toString() method formatting the object outputs consistently. Create 
getter/setter methods as appropriate for this class given what I’ve described. Please include 
proper JavaDoc documentation and ask for input validation and error handling where appropriate 
within this class. Ensure common Java naming conventions are followed throughout the class as 
well please. Can you also include this “ai generation documentation” header, in-between the 
package and class header? Don’t fill it out, I can do that part myself: 
/** 
* AI GENERATION DOCUMENTATION
* * 
* =========================== 
* * AI Tool Used: [Name and version] 
* * Generation Date: [Date] 
* * * Original Prompt: 
* * "[Your exact prompt here]" 
* * * Follow-up Prompts (if any): 
* * 1. "[Refinement prompt 1]" 
1. * 2. "[Refinement prompt 2]" * 
2. * Manual Modifications: 
* * - [List any changes you made to the AI output] 
- * - [Explain why changes were necessary] * 
- * Formula Verification: 
* * - Volume formula verified against: [source] 
- * - Surface area formula verified against: [source] 
- */







## Interaction 2 Cube, Cylinder, Pyramid, RectangularPrism, Sphere
Can you also create the following Java classes with the following properties, in the same 
package as Shape3D: Sphere (properties: radius), Cube (properties: sideLength), Cylinder 
(properties: radius, height), RectangularPrism (properties: length, width, height), and 
Pyramid (properties: width, length, height). Each of the classes needs to extend Shape 3D. 
Each class needs to implement the abstract calculation methods from Shape3D. include proper 
contructors with validation. Override the toString() but use shape-specific formatting. Please 
include proper JavaDoc documentation and ask for input validation and error handling where 
appropriate within this class. Ensure common Java naming conventions are followed throughout 
the class as well please.







## Interaction 3 Test Classes
For each of the shape classes we just created we also need to generate Junit 5 test classes. We 
need to test Basic Functionality (Constructor, getters, setters), Calculation Accuracy (Volume and 
surface area with known values), Boundary Testing (Zero values, very small/large numbers), Input Validation 
(Negative values, null inputs), and Inheritance Testing (Polymorphic behavior verification). Please maintain 
Java naming conventions, and comments that help me understand what’s within these testing classes like you’ve 
done for the other classes.
