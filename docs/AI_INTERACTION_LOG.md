# AI Interaction Log

This document serves as a log of interactions with AI systems, capturing prompts, responses, and 
reflections on the outcomes. It is intended to help users track their engagements with AI and 
improve future interactions.




## Interaction 1 Shape3d
Can you create me a class in Java called Shape3d inside the package com.csc205.project2.shapes 
package, that implements the interface ThreeDimensionalShape containing abstract methods double 
getSurfaceArea() and double getVolume(). Create concrete implementations of getVolume() and 
getSufaceArea() in Shape3D that call the abstract methods from the interface. Create 2 property 
variables String name and String color, and can you make them private, but create getters and 
setters that are public for each of those properties. Create the constructor for the class for 
initialization. Create a toString() method formatting the object outputs consistently. Create 
getter/setter methods as appropriate for this class given what I’ve described. Please include 
proper JavaDoc documentation and ask for input validation and error handling where appropriate 
within this class. Ensure common Java naming conventions are followed throughout the class as 
well please. Can you also include this “ai generation documentation” header, in-between the 
package and class header? Don’t fill it out, I can do that part myself:
