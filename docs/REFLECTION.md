This document serves as a log of reflections on various topics, capturing insights, lessons learned, and personal growth. It is intended to help users track their thoughts and experiences over time.

Reflection Questions:
AI Effectiveness: Where did AI tools excel? Where did they struggle?

Code Quality Comparison: How does AI-generated code compare to manual coding?

Learning Experience: What did you learn about inheritance AND AI-assisted development?

Validation Process: How did you ensure the AI-generated code was correct?

Future Applications: How will you use AI tools in future programming projects?


1st Reflection:
I used ChatGPT to generate the Shape3D class, and it copied into the IDE with a weird error. The
IDE didn't like the Shape3D class name, and suggested it be named Shape3D? I enabled the change and
the error disappeared. Other than that I believe the code was generated how I needed it to.
