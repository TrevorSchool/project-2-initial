# Reflections Log

This document serves as a log of reflections on various topics, capturing insights, lessons learned, and personal growth. It is intended to help users track their thoughts and experiences over time.

Reflection Questions:
AI Effectiveness: Where did AI tools excel? Where did they struggle?

Code Quality Comparison: How does AI-generated code compare to manual coding?

Learning Experience: What did you learn about inheritance AND AI-assisted development?

Validation Process: How did you ensure the AI-generated code was correct?

Future Applications: How will you use AI tools in future programming projects?


1st Reflection:
I used ChatGPT to generate the Shape3D class, and it copied into the IDE with a weird error. The
IDE didn't like the Shape3D class name, and suggested it be named Shape3D? I enabled the change and
the error disappeared. Other than that I believe the code was generated how I needed it to.




2nd Reflection:
I figured out that the class name issue I had yesterday was because the class name was 
"Shape3D" while the subclasses extended "shape3d" so I refactored and let technology fix the 
classes for me. Using AI has been a great experience so far and I am looking forward to it 
saving me more time and energy. Being specific in my prompts has helped me avoid errors in 
the software so far.




3rd Reflection:
I created the test classes for each of the shape classes and I ran into no issues. I looked at 
what we needed the test classes to do and researched what I didn't know, communicated that to chatGPT in a clear 
and specific manner and was able to create all test classes using one prompt. After inserting the test classes into 
the project I used chatGPT as a refresher for how to run test. I decided to test each class individually and then
followed-up by right-clicking the java directory within test and selecting "Run 'All Tests" to make sure the whole 
project passed in one test. There wasn't a single error, and I am confident the program will run after I add to the 
driver class.





4th Reflection: 
I created the Driver class with ChatGPT and I am very pleased with the results. The only issue I had with the original 
code was that it reference Shape3D as Shape3d (a mistake I fixed earlier), so I need to communicate that to my AI so 
it knows for the future. This was a great learning experience. Next I plan on
